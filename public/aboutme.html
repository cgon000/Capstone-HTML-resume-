<h2>Always looking to learn and try new things!</h2>
<p>I'm 28 years old and currently living in Fort Worth, Texas. Born in The Philippines,
I spent most of my upbringing in Texas. I live with my parents, two younger siblings, and two dogs!</p>

<p>I'm currently studying UX Design and Web Development. 
From a young age, I explored creativity through sketching, Legos, and character 
design inspired by video games and movies. Throughout high school I found a lot of 
fulfillment in problem-solving and helping others, leading me to a career in healthcare. 
While rewarding, I discovered that technology allows me to merge creativity, design, and impact
in a meaningful way.</p>
<br />
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Running & Weight lifiting</li>
        <li>Eating out</li>
        <li>Muay Thai</li>
        <li>Painting</li>
        <li>Photography</li>    
    </ul>
<br />
<h3>I often dream of traveling the world and starting a non-profit for the homeless and hungry.</h3>
